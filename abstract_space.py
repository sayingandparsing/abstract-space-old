    ThreadManager encapsulates the means of communication and control between
    the main AbstractSpace class (below), and the listener and UI processes.

    EventListener continuously queries the Xlib display server for keypress
    events, and thus must run on a separate thread. Similarly, ViewContext
    maintains the GUI toolkit's event loop, which also blocks other activities.
    Since AbstractSpace updates the view in response to incoming key events,
    it needs to exchange data and commands with each. So ThreadManager creates
    two-way pipes, one end of which are used to initialize XEventListener and
    ViewContext, which inherit from ThreadedPipe and ProcessPipe*, respectively.

    * due to peculiarities of Qt, it is required to run as a separate Process
    instead of as a Thread
